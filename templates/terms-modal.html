            In these terms and conditions, when we say the “DappList” we mean the digital information network operated by or on behalf of Eth Dev CIC or its parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively “Eth Dev” or “Ethereum”), regardless of how you access the network and information therein. However you access the DappList, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If you have accessed the Eth Dev and Ethereum websites from the United States or Australia, you also agree to be bound by additional terms contained at the end of these terms and conditions.

            By subscribing, you agree to let us use the data you provided to send you information that we think will be interesting or useful to you. You can unsubscribe at any time and we'll make sure there's a valid unsubscribe link in everything we send by mass mail. If you no longer accept these terms and conditions, or any future modification to these terms and conditions, you must cease receiving the DappList. Continued use of the DappList indicates your continued acceptance of these terms and conditions.

            1.      DappList Policies:
            <br/>
            You agree to let us send personal one-to-one communications to you. Examples of this may include sending you mail address verification messages, and replying to queries sent from your mail address.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hate spam. Unless you authorize it or we're compelled by law, we won't share your mail address with anyone else, ever.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We value your information. We'll keep it as secure as we can. We will notify you if any breaches occur.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will send mail at reasonable intervals, which is at most a few times a month and definitely not once a day.
          </p>
          

          <p>
            We'll do our best to meet all applicable privacy, spam, and other relevant rules and regulations. If you think we've failed to do that, please contact us so we can investigate and correct as required.

          <p>
            10. Governing law & jurisdiction (for US users)
            <br/>
            If you have accessed the DappList from the US, these terms and conditions are governed by the laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of New York. You agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute with DappList or relating in any way to your use of the DappList resides in the courts of the County of New York, State of New York, and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the courts of the County of New York, State of New York, in connection with any such dispute and including any claim involving DappList or its parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, employees, contractors, officers, directors, telecommunication providers and content providers.

          </p>

          <p>
            11. Additional disclaimers
            <br/>
            Users to the DappList agree that their use of the DappList is at their own sole risk. The DappList is provided "as is" and "as available," without warranty of any kind, either express or implied including but not limited to: (i) any warranties concerning the availability, accuracy, appropriateness, reliability, timeliness, or usefulness of the content of the DappList; and (ii) any warranties of title, warranty of non-infringement, or warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. DappList also makes no representations and warranties as to any linked sites and DappList has no liability or responsibility with respect to your use of such sites. In some instances, content made available on the DappList may represent the opinions and judgments of providers or users, such as user content. DappList and its affiliates do not endorse nor shall they be responsible or liable for the accuracy or reliability of any statement made on the DappList by anyone other than authorised DappList employees acting in such capacity.
          </p>

          
          <p>
            This disclaimer of liability applies to any damages or injuries caused by the DappList, including, without limitation, those damages or injuries occurring as a result of: (i) any error, omission, deletion, or defect in the content available on the DappList; or (ii) any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft or destruction of records, information or data, unauthorised access to, alteration of, or use of records, information or data, whether for breach of contract, tort, negligence, defamation, or any other cause of action. DappList does not warrant or guarantee that access to the DappList will be uninterrupted or error-free.
          </p>

          <p>
            Applicable law may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            12. Limitation of liability
            <br/>
            YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, IN NO EVENT WILL DAPPLIST OR ITS AFFILIATES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT LOSS, DAMAGE, COST, EXPENSE OR LIABILITY OF ANY KIND ("LOSS") ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE AVAILABILITY, USE, RELIANCE ON, OR INABILITY TO USE THE DAPPLIST, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION): (i) DAMAGES FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS AND OTHER PROFITS, LOSS OF PROGRAMS, COST OF REPLACING EQUIPMENT OR SOFTWARE OR LOSS OF RECORDS, INFORMATION OR DATA, LOSS OF USE OF DATA, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF CUSTOMERS, LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO REPUTATION, LOSS OF CAPITAL, DOWNTIME COSTS, LOSS UNDER OR IN RELATION TO ANY OTHER CONTRACT, OR LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS OR BENEFITS; (ii) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS; OR (iii) ANY LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR OTHER INACCURACIES IN THE DAPPLIST. THE EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION 17 APPLIES EVEN IF DAPPLIST SHALL HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS.
          </p>

          
          <p>
            BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PARTICULAR KINDS OF LOSS, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, DAPPLIST'S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (THEREBY MINIMIZING DAPPLIST'S LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE LOWEST AMOUNT THAT APPLICABLE LAW PERMITS).
          </p>

          <p>
            13. Exclusion of warranties (for Australian users)
            <br/>
            The Australian Consumer Law may confer certain rights and remedies on you in relation to the provision by DappList of goods and services under these terms and conditions. Notwithstanding the disclaimers and limitations of liability in Sections 4, 16 and 17 above, these terms and conditions do not exclude, restrict or modify the application of any condition, warranty, guarantee, right or remedy conferred by or implied under any provision of the Australian Consumer Law or any other statute where to do so would: (i) contravene the relevant statute; or (ii) cause any part of these terms and conditions to be void and/or unenforceable ("Non-Excludable Obligation").
          </p>

          <p>
            Except in relation to Non-Excludable Obligations, all conditions, warranties and other provisions implied or conferred by statute, custom, or the general law that impose any liability or obligation on DappList are expressly excluded under these terms and conditions.
          </p>

          <p>
            14. Non-Excludable Obligations (for Australian users)
            <br/>
            In relation to Non-Excludable Obligations (other than a guarantee as to title, encumbrances or quiet possession conferred by the Australian Consumer Law), except for goods or services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption (in respect of which our liability is not so limited under these terms and conditions), DappList's liability to you for a failure to comply with any Non-Excludable Obligation is limited to: (i) in the case of services, the lowest of the cost of supplying the services again and payment of the cost of having the services supplied again; and (ii) in the case of goods, the lowest of the cost of replacing the goods, supplying equivalent goods or having the goods repaired, or payment of the cost of replacing the goods, supplying equivalent goods or having the goods repaired.
